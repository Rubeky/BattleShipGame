# BattleShipGame
Game of battleship within Python, requires TKinter

The point of this project was to develop an understanding of TKinter as well as some basics of python
(This is my first project in python, but I am relatively fluid in similar programming languages like MATLAB)

If anyone wants to use any parts of this code, feel free but please leave a link to this github somewhere in comments!
